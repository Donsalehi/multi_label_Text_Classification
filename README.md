# multi_label_Text_Classification
This project focuses on multi-label text classification, where a single text sample can belong to multiple categories. Using machine learning and deep learning techniques, it processes textual data, extracts meaningful features, and applies classification models to predict multiple labels for each input text.

### **Key Features:**
- **Text Preprocessing**: stopword removal, stemming, and TF-IDF vectorization.
- **Multi-Label Classification Models**: Logistic Regression and Neural Networks.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: F1-score, Accuracy and Hamming loss for multi-label classification.
